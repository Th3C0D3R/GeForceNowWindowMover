# GeForceNow WindowMover
This Application exists because I could not find a working programm to resize/move the game window which 
GeForce NOW shows when inside a game.

## HOW TO USE (precompiled)
#### The program currently must be run everytime you enter a new game
1) Start GeForce NOW and start the game you want
2) When the game is fullscreen run the `GeForceNowWindowMover.exe`
3) On first run, you need to adjust the position and size of the game you want by resizing/moving the red box
3.1) Save it (or Cancel and close the application)
4) Choose the process you want to modify (ideally it should only be 1)
5) Wait for the program to be done and you saw the messsage box!

## Compile your own
Just clone the repo and compile, it should work out of the box (I compiled it with Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 4.8)
